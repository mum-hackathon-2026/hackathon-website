# Security Rules

These rules apply to all code generated in this project. They are non-negotiable.

## Secrets

- NEVER put API keys, database credentials, or tokens in frontend code (anything under src/, app/, pages/, components/, public/)
- NEVER put secret keys in environment variables prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_, VITE_, or REACT_APP_ (these are bundled into the client)
- NEVER hardcode credentials in source files. Use environment variables loaded server-side only
- The .env file MUST be in .gitignore before the first commit. Verify this before creating any .env file
- Use .env.example with placeholder values only, never real credentials

## Database

- Enable Row Level Security on EVERY Supabase table before deployment. Default policy: deny all. Write explicit policies scoped to auth.uid()
- NEVER set a Supabase RLS policy to `USING (true)` or `FOR ALL` without a WHERE condition
- Firebase Security Rules MUST require `request.auth != null` and scope access to `request.auth.uid`
- NEVER use `pickle.loads`, `pickle.load`, or any deserialization on user-supplied data. Use JSON for all network data exchange

## Authentication and Authorization

- EVERY API route that returns or modifies user data MUST have authentication middleware that runs BEFORE the handler, not inside it
- Unauthenticated requests to protected endpoints MUST return 401
- EVERY route that takes a resource ID MUST verify the authenticated user owns that resource: `current_user.id == resource.owner_id`. This is a SEPARATE check from authentication
- Admin endpoints MUST verify admin role and return 403 for non-admin users
- Session cookies MUST set `httpOnly: true`, `secure: true`, and `sameSite: 'lax'`

## Input and Output

- NEVER concatenate user input into SQL queries. ALWAYS use parameterized queries or ORM methods
- NEVER use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, `v-html`, or `innerHTML` with user-supplied content unless it is first sanitized with DOMPurify
- ALL user input MUST be validated server-side. Client-side validation is for UX only
- File uploads MUST validate file type by reading magic bytes, not by checking the filename extension. Rename all uploads to UUIDs server-side. Store on a separate domain (S3, R2, GCS), never on the app origin

## URL Fetching (SSRF Prevention)

- If the application fetches URLs provided by users (link previews, image proxies, URL validators):
  - Block requests to internal/private IP ranges (127.0.0.0/8, 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16, 169.254.0.0/16, [::1], [fc00::/7], [fe80::/10])
  - Resolve DNS and validate the IP BEFORE making the request
  - Disable redirect following or re-validate every redirect URL
